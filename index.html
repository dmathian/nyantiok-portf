                <h3>CEPH MPH Foundational Competences</h3>
                <h2>Evidence-based Approaches to Public Health</h2>
<p>Public health practice requires rigorous, evidence-based methods to address health challenges. Professionals apply epidemiological techniques to analyze disease patterns and health determinants across diverse settings. They select appropriate quantitative and qualitative data collection methods tailored to specific contexts, then analyze this data using biostatistics, informatics, and specialized software. The final critical step involves interpreting findings to inform research, policies, and practical interventions that improve population health outcomes.</p>

<h2>Public Health & Healthcare Systems</h2>
<p>Effective public health practice demands deep understanding of complex healthcare systems. Professionals compare organizational structures and functions across national and international settings to identify best practices. A crucial component involves recognizing how structural biases, social inequities, and systemic racism create health disparities, enabling the development of strategies to advance health equity at all societal levels.</p>

<h2>Planning & Management to Promote Health</h2>
<p>Successful public health initiatives require comprehensive planning and management. This begins with thorough community needs assessments to ensure targeted interventions. Programs must incorporate cultural values to enhance relevance and acceptance, while adhering to sound budgeting and resource management principles. Continuous evaluation of public health programs ensures accountability and drives quality improvement in service delivery.</p>

<h2>Policy in Public Health</h2>
<p>Public health policy significantly influences population health outcomes. Professionals must understand the policymaking process, including how evidence and ethics shape decisions. Building strategic partnerships strengthens advocacy efforts for health-promoting policies. Policy evaluation ensures interventions effectively address health disparities and achieve equitable outcomes.</p>

                <h3>CU MPH Concentration Competency</h3>
                <h2>Evidence-Based Approaches to Public Health</h2>
<P>Public health professionals must employ evidence-based strategies to address health challenges effectively. This involves applying epidemiological methods across diverse public health settings to identify patterns, causes, and effects of health conditions. Selecting appropriate quantitative and qualitative data collection methods ensures accurate and relevant information for specific contexts. Analyzing this data using biostatistics, informatics, and programming tools allows for meaningful insights. Finally, interpreting results helps inform public health research, policy decisions, and practical interventions to improve community health outcomes.</P>

<h2>Public Health & Healthcare Systems</h2>
<p>Understanding the organization, structure, and function of healthcare and public health systems is essential for effective health governance. Comparing these systems across national and international settings highlights differences in accessibility, efficiency, and regulatory frameworks. Additionally, recognizing how structural bias, social inequities, and systemic racism negatively impact health is crucial. These barriers create persistent challenges in achieving health equity at organizational, community, and societal levels, requiring targeted interventions to promote fairness and inclusivity.</p>

<h2>Planning & Management to Promote Health</h2>
<p>Effective public health planning and management involve strategic problem-solving to enhance community well-being. Professionals must apply negotiation and mediation skills to resolve organizational or community challenges, fostering collaboration among stakeholders. By developing and implementing structured health initiatives, public health leaders can address disparities and improve population health outcomes.</p>

<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>Clear and tailored communication is vital in public health to ensure messages resonate with diverse audiences. Selecting appropriate communication strategies for different sectors enhances engagement and understanding. Public health professionals must convey complex information effectively through written reports and oral presentations while adapting content to audience needs. Emphasizing cultural competence in communication helps bridge gaps and fosters trust within diverse communities.</p>

<p>Collaboration across disciplines is key to addressing complex public health issues. Working effectively in interprofessional teams allows professionals to leverage diverse expertise, improving program design, implementation, and evaluation. Strong teamwork ensures comprehensive approaches to health challenges, enhancing service delivery and health outcomes.</p>

<h2>Systems Thinking</h2>
<p>Public health challenges often require a holistic perspective to identify underlying causes and interconnected factors. Applying systems thinking tools helps professionals analyze public health issues dynamically, considering social, economic, and environmental influences. This approach supports the development of sustainable, large-scale solutions that address root causes rather than just symptoms.</p>

                <h3>Reflective Statement</h3>
                <p>I am passionate about infection control in acute care and skilled nursing facilities, where preventing healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) is critical for patient safety. My goal is to apply evidence-based practices to reduce infections and later expand my impact globally by working in developing countries on infectious disease research, outbreak response, and public health initiatives. With a BSN, MHP, and years of clinical nursing experience, I have a strong background in epidemiology, infection prevention, and patient care. My hands-on expertise allows me to identify risks, implement protocols, and train healthcare teams effectively. This combination of education and experience gives me a competitive edge in infection control roles, whether in clinical or research settings. Ultimately, I aim to merge frontline patient care with global health efforts, improving infection control standards worldwide and creating safer healthcare environments for vulnerable populations.</p>

                <p>This paper presents a three-year public health business plan for establishing a sustainable clinic in Pan-de-Laul Village, South Sudan, focusing on primary care, maternal health, disease prevention, and community engagement to improve health outcomes. The plan highlights budgetary and resource management skills, social marketing strategies, and potential collaborations with nearby NGOs, such as those in Jamjung, to address healthcare challenges like malaria and cholera. The clinic’s vision is to provide accessible, affordable, and high-quality healthcare, while its mission emphasizes comprehensive services, education, and local capacity-building for long-term sustainability. Social marketing will be employed to promote positive behavioral changes and partnerships with government agencies and NGOs to enhance healthcare delivery in the region.</p>
